# master

# 0.0.7

* Bind to `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost`
* Add `factory.env` based on `$BROCCOLI_ENV`
* Do not fail on invalid Cookie header
* Use promises instead of callbacks in all external APIs, except preprocessors (which are going away in a future refactoring)

# 0.0.6

* Here be dragons
